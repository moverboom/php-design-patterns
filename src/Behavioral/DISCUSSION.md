# Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral Patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
These patterns characterize comples control of flow that's difficult to
follow at run-time, and shift your focus awy from flow of control to let you
concentrate just on the way objects are interconnected.
Behavioral *class* patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes.
Behavrioral *object* patterns use object composition rather than inheritance.
