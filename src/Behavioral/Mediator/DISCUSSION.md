# Mediator
Define an object that defines how a set of object interact.
The mediator serves as an intermediary that keeps
objects that should work together from referencing
each other directly. They only know the mediator.
This also removes behaviour from those objects,
allowing the objects themselves to be re-used while
behaviour changes.
