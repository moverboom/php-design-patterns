# Creational Patterns
Creational patterns abstract the instantiation process and helpt make a systems independent
of how its objects are created.

Two keys points here are that all creational patterns:
* Encapsulate the knowledge of which concrete classes there are
* Hide how the instances are created and put together

The patterns can also collaborate, for example Builder could use a Factory to create the instances
needed to build an object.
