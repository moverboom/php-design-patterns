# Adapter (also known as Wrapper)
Converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects. It lets
classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Class adapter uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another.
Object adapter relies on object composition.
