# Facade
Provides an interface to use a set of interfaces in a subsystem, that makes the subsystem
easier to use. This helps keep the dependencies on the subsystem to a minimum.
The goal isn't to hide the subsystem, but create a unified interface for clients that are
not interested in the specifics of the subsystem.
